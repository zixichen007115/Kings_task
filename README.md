## task1
### description: 
In most real-world applications, labelled data is scarce. Suppose you are given the MNIST dataset, but without any labels in the training set. The labels are held in a database,
which you may query to reveal the label of any particular image it contains. Your task is to build a classifier
to >90% accuracy on the test set, using the smallest number of queries to this database.

You may use any combination of techniques you find suitable (supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised).
However, using other datasets or pre-trained models is not allowed.

### method:
1.random selection(baseline)

2.PCA + KMEANS + CNN

3.AE + KMEANS +CNN

### result:

1.acc

2.parameter influence
